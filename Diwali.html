The history of Diwali 
is replete with legends and these legends are moored to the stories of Hindu 
religious scriptures, mostly the Puranas. Though the central theme of all 
legends point out to the classic truth of the victory of the good over the 
evils, the mode of their presentation and the characters differ. Diwali, being 
the festival of lights, lighting the lamp of knowledge within us means to 
understand and reflect upon the significant purpose of each of the five days of 
festivities and to bring those thoughts in to the day to day lives.

<U>The five day of Diwali</U></FONT></B><BR>The first day of Diwali is called 
Dhanvantari Triodasi or Dhanwantari Triodasi also called Dhan Theras. The second 
day of Diwali is called Narak Chaturdasi. It is the fourteenth lunar day 
(thithi) of the dark forthnight of the month of Kartik and the eve of Diwali. On 
this day Lord Krishna destroyed the demon Narakasur and made the world free from 
fear. The third day of Diwali is the actual Diwali. This is the day when worship 
for Mother Lakshmi is performed. On the fourth day of Diwali, Goverdhan Pooja is 
performed. The fifth day of the diwali is called Bhratri Dooj. It is a day 
dedicated to sisters. <BR><BR><B><font color="BLUE">

<U>The Story of Rama and Sita:</STRONG></U></FONT> Lord Rama was a great warrior King who was exiled by his 
father Dashratha, the King of Ayodhya, along with his wife Sita and his younger 
brother Lakshman, on his wife's insistence. Lord Rama returned to his Kingdom 
Ayodhya after 14 years of exile, in which he put an end to the demon Ravana of 
Lanka, who was a great Pundit, highly learned but still evil dominated his mind. 
After this victory of Good over Evil, Rama returned to Ayodhya. In Ayodhya, the 
people welcomed them by lighting rows of clay lamps. So, it is an occasion in 
honor of Rama's victory over Ravana; of Truth's victory over Evil.

<U>The Story of King Bali and Vamana Avatar(the Dwarf):</U></FONT></STRONG> 
The other story concerns King Bali, who was a generous ruler. But he was also 
very ambitious. Some of the Gods pleaded Vishnu to check King Bali's power. 
Vishnu came to earth in the form of a Vamana(dwarf) dressed as priest. The dwarf 
approached King Bali and said "You are the ruler of the three worlds: the Earth, 
the world above the skies and the underworld. Would you give me the space that I 
could cover with three strides?" King Bali laughed. Surely a dwarf could not 
cover much ground, thought the King, who agreed to dwarf's request. At this 
point, the dwarf changed into Vishnu and his three strides covered the Earth, 
the Skies and the whole Universe! King Bali was send to the underworld. As part 
of Diwali celebrations, some Hindus remember King Bali. <BR><BR><STRONG>

<U>The 
Defeat of Narkasur by Lord Krishna:</U></FONT></STRONG> Lord Vishnu in his 8th incarnation 
as Krishna destroyed the demon Narkasura, who was causing great unhappiness 
amongst the people of the world. Narkasura was believed to be a demon of filth, 
covered in dirt. He used to kidnap beautiful young women and force them to live 
with him. Eventually, their cries for rescue were heard by Vishnu, who came in 
the form of Krishna. First, Krishna had to fight with a five-headed monster who 
guarded the demon's home. Narkasura hoped that his death might bring joy to 
others. Krishna granted his request and the women were freed. For Hindus, this 
story is a reminder that good can still come out of evil. 
<BR><BR><STRONG><font color="YELLOW">
<U>Krishna and The Mountain:</U></FONT></STRONG> In the village of Gokula, 
many years ago, the people prayed to the God Indra. They believed that Indra 
sent the rains, which made their crops, grow. But Krishna came along and 
persuaded the people to worship the mountain Govardhan, because the mountain and 
the land around it were fertile. This did not please Indra. He sent thunder and 
torrential rain down on the village. The people cried to Krishna to help. 
Krishna saved the villagers by lifting the top of the mountain with his finger. 
The offering of food to God on this day of Diwali is a reminder to Hindus of the 
importance of food and it is a time for being thankful to God for the bounty of 
nature. <BR><BR></DIV>

<U>Sikh Festival Diwali:</U></FONT></B> <BR>In Sikh 
perspective, Diwali is celebrated as the return of the sixth Guru, Guru 
Hargobind Ji from the captivity of the city, Gwalior. To commemorate his undying 
love for Sikhism, the towns people lit the way to, Harmandhir Sahib (referred to 
as the Golden Temple), in his honour. <BR><BR><B><font color="YELLOW">
<U>Jain Festival 
Diwali:</U></FONT></B><BR>Among the Jain festivals, Diwali is one of the most important one. 
For on this occasion we celebrate the Nirvana of Lord Mahavira who established 
the dharma as we follow it. Lord Mahavira was born as Vardhamana on Chaitra 
Shukla 13th in the Nata clan at Khattiya-kundapura, near Vaishali. He obtained 
Kevala Gyana on Vishakha Shukla 10 at the Jambhraka village on the banks of 
Rijukula river at the age of 42.
