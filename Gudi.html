<p><b> <font color="black">On Gudi Padwa, a gudi is found hanging out of a window or otherwise prominently displayed in traditional Maharashtrian households. 
Gudi is a bright green or yellow cloth adorned with brocade (zari) tied to the tip of a long bamboo over which gathi (sugar crystals),
 neem leaves[a twig of mango leaves and a garland of red flowers is tied. A silver or copper pot is placed in the inverted position over it.
  This gudi is then hoisted outside the house, in a window, terrace or a high place so that everybody can see it.
Some of the significances attributed to raising a Gudhi are as follows
</p><ul>
<LI>Gudhi symbolizes the Brahmadhvaj Brahma mentioned in the Brahma Purana, because Lord Brahma created the universe on this day.
 It may also represent Indradhvaj </LI>
 <LI>"	Mythologically, the Gudhi symbolizes Lord Rama's victory and happiness on returning to Ayodhya after slaying Ravan. 
 Since a symbol of victory is always held high, so is the gudi (flag). It is believed that this festival is celebrated to 
 commemorate the coronation of Rama post his return to Ayodhya after completing 14 years of exilt.
</LI>
<LI>"	Maharashtrians also see the Gudhi as a symbol of victory associated with the conquests of the Maratha forces led by 
Chhatrapati Shivaji. It also symbolizes the victory of King Shalivahana over Sakas and was hoisted by his 
people when he returned to Paithan.
</LI>
<li>"	Gudhi is believed to ward off evil, invite prosperity and good luck into the house.

<p><IMG SRC="1\G37.JPG" ALIGN="RIGHT" height=100 width=150>The Divine consciousness emanating during sunrise, absorbed at that time lasts longer. Thus the Gudi should be worshipped within 5-10 minutes after sunrise !

On Gudi Padwa, the waves consisting of the fire principle (Tej tatva) and the creative Prajapati waves are activated on a large scale. 
The Divine consciousness emanating during sunrise, absorbed at that time lasts longer. This consciousness is stored in the body cells
 and is used as required. Hence the Gudi should be worshipped within 5-10 minutes after sunrise.

<p>Position of the Gudi: Care should be taken to raise the Gudi next to the main entrance of the house. 
The spot selected should be on the right side of the entrance(when facing outwards from the entrance of the home). 
 The right side symbolizes the active state of the soul.</p>
 <p>1. The area selected for raising the Gudi should be cleaned and then a Swastik rangoli should be drawn on the ground.
  Turmeric and vermilion (Haldi-kumkum) should be offered at the centre of the Swastik.</p>
  <p>2. While raising the Gudi, the 'Shiva-Shakti' principle in the Universe should be invoked.
   This enables all the constituents of the Gudi to accept divine principles.</p>
   <p>3. The Gudi symbolizes the �Sushumna nadi� of our body. Hence, the Gudi should be raised at the entrance. 
   And it should be kept tilted at an angle. - A Scholar (through the medium of Ms. Anjali Gadgil)</p>

<font color="red">Prayer :-</span></font>
<p>'O Lord Brahma, Lord Vishnu ! Please enable me to absorb the Principle of Creation and the Fire Principle present in the atmosphere. 
Let the Divine consciousness present in these principles be preserved constantly.
 Let the energy thus received, be used for my spiritual practice.'</p>
