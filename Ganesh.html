      size=4 text="white"><b>The annual festival in honor of 
      <U>Ganesh</U> or Ganapati, the elephant-headed deity who is known as the 
      remover of obstacles and the god of auspiciousness, has been observed for 
      at least 250 years, and perhaps at least since the twelfth century. It was 
      at first an affair that lasted for two days or less, but by the middle 
      part of the eighteenth century, in the reign of Madhavrao (1761-72), it 
      began to be celebrated over six days. The modern history of the Ganapati 
      festival dates back to 1894, when the Maratha politician and Indian 
      nationalist, Bal Gangadhar Tilak, lionized as Lokamanya, or "Beloved of 
      the People", gave it a distinct political face. Though the festival had 
      largely been a private affair, where each family purchased an idol of 
      Ganesh and then took it out in procession on Ganesh Chaturthi before 
      immersing it in the river, pond, or tank, it had not been without its 
      public and community aspect, since often several families joined in the 
      procession, or otherwise pooled together their resources to buy a 
      larger-sized idol. But one of Tilak’s achievements was to make the 
      Ganapati festival the vehicle, so to speak, for the aspirations of the 
      Maratha people as well as those of other Indians who desired independence 
      from British tutelage. Henceforth, the Ganapati festival was to become a 
      largely public affair.<p align="center"><font size="4"><a class="two" href="GANESH2.HTML">
      <font color="#000000"  face="Showcard Gothic "></font></a></font>
      <P>The precise 
      innovations introduced by Tilak consisted in making the Ganapati festival 
      into a community-based enterprise. Subscriptions were collected on behalf 
      of a residential area, market, or organization for the purchase of large 
      idols of Ganesh, which were then placed on pavilions (<I>mandaps</I>) and 
      made the object of collective worship. Secondly, whereas previously 
      immersions had taken place on various days of the festival, Tilak sought 
      to have all the immersions take place on the tenth and final day. Thirdly, 
      various song-and-dance parties were attached to each mandap, and more 
      often than not, the songs had strong political overtones. Fourthly, some 
      of the mandaps were themselves made the site of political plays, and 
      groups of young boys and men, who dressed in military uniform and shouted 
      political slogans, staged marches in the community that was hosting the 
      mandap. In this manner, Tilak sought to link the Ganapati festival to his 
      political agenda, and as his newspaper <I>Kesari</I> openly editorialized 
      (8 September 1896): "This work [of political education] will not be as 
      strenuous and expensive as the work of the Congress. The educated people 
      can achieve results through these national festivals which it would be 
      impossible for the Congress to achieve. Why shouldn’t we convert the large 
      religious festivals into mass political rallies? Will it not be possible 
      for political activities to enter the humblest cottages of the villages 
      through such means?"</P><IMG SRC="IMAGE\gan1.JPG" ALIGN="RIGHT" height=250 width=300>
      <P>Within two years, the 
      Ganapati festival in its new form had been widely accepted across the 
      Marathi-speaking parts of the Bombay Presidency, and Bombay, Nasik, 
      Sattara, and other cities were to follow Pune’s example. But the 
      politicization of the festival was to invite the attention of the British 
      government, which though at first inclined to view the developments as 
      devoid of much political significance, was soon to take the position that 
      many of the active participants in the festival had little interest in 
      religious affairs, but were certainly interested in fomenting political 
      unrest. As long as the festival had been intended, as the British 
      believed, to turn the Hindus away from Muharram, in which Hindu 
      participation had not been an insignificant factor, they were not disposed 
      to interfere; but when the festival took on "the character of an annual 
      anti-Government eruption", to quote the words of the Bombay Police 
      Commissioner in 1910, it was felt necessary to take some action. Moreover, 
      the transformation of the festival was seen as an attempt by the Brahmins 
      to regain their traditional leadership roles, and the British thought they 
      also detected in this enterprise a glorification of the martial traditions 
      associated with Shivaji and the Marathas. Consequently, by 1910, the 
      Ganapati festival would be severely curtailed on the government’s 
      orders.</P>
      <P>In its present form, 
      the Ganapati festival, which is best observed in Pune or Bombay (now 
      Mumbai), retains to a very large degree the characteristics with which it 
      was endowed by Tilak. The festival is observed for ten days, and 
      immersions of the deity are carried out over the last twenty-four hours of 
      the festival, and the honor of the last immersions, when immense crowds 
      are gathered, falls to the most well-known or affluent communities. 
      Pavilions are put up by various communities, residential blocks, streets, 
      markets, wealthy merchants or industrialists, and organizations, and an 
      image, usually quite lavish, of Ganesh is placed on each <I>mandap</I>. 
      But political themes might predominate, as they did in 1999, when the 
      sacrifice of the Indian soldier upon the heights of Kargil was repeatedly 
      evoked. In one particular mandap in Pune by the name of "Vijay Maruti", an 
      elaborate set featuring an assault upon one of the mountain tops where 
      Pakistani soldiers had taken a commanding position provided the spectators 
      with a ‘live’ representation of the conflict and the eventual triumph of 
      Indian forces. Thus, once again, in the Ganapati festival the interests of 
      the nation-state are conjoined with patriotism as well as devotion to the 
      deity. Notwithstanding its politicization, the Ganapati festival is an 
      extraordinary testimony to the public place of religion in Indian life, 
      the liveliness of Indian communities, the splendors of street life, the 
      strength of popular artistic and artisan traditions, and the glorious 
      malleability of one beloved Indian deity.</FONT></P></b>
