                 The celebration of Holi&nbsp; is very ancient in 
                    its origin. And by its very origin, it celebrates&nbsp;an 
                    ultimate triumph of the 'good' over the 'evil'.&nbsp;While, 
                    a feast of colors associated with the Holi, is the face of 
                    this celebration,&nbsp;the original reason of celebrating 
                    Holi, lies in its soul.&nbsp;&nbsp;And this gives us the 
                    'why' of this ancient festival.&nbsp;<BR><BR>Literally 
                    "Holi" signifies "burning" in Indian language.&nbsp;But, how 
                    it came to be associated with 'burning', is a story. The 
                    reference is found only in ancinet Indian 
                    mythology.&nbsp;And It is the legend of 
                    Hiranyakashipu,&nbsp;to whom the celebration of Holi is 
                    associated.&nbsp;<BR><BR>Way back in the pre-Christian 
                    era,&nbsp;there lived a demon king named Hiranyakashipu in 
                    ancient India.&nbsp;He wanted to avenge the death of his 
                    younger brother.&nbsp;The brother, also a demon, had been 
                    killed by Lord Vishnu,&nbsp;one of the supreme trio, 
                    monitoring the life and death in the <IMG SRC="1\g30.jpg" ALIGN="LEFT" HEIGHT=150 WIDTH=200></IMG>
                    universe,&nbsp;(according to the Hindu belief).&nbsp;To take 
                    on Vishnu, the tyrant king wanted&nbsp;to become the king of 
                    the heaven, earth and the underworld.&nbsp;<BR>He performed 
                    severe penance and prayer&nbsp;for many years to gain enough 
                    power.&nbsp;<BR>Finally he was granted a boon.&nbsp;Powered 
                    by the boon,&nbsp;Hiranyakshipu thought he had become 
                    invincible.&nbsp;Arrogant, he ordered all in his kingdom to 
                    worship him, instead of God.&nbsp;The demon king, however, 
                    had a very young son, named Prahalad.&nbsp;<BR>He was an 
                    ardent devotee of Vishnu.<IMG SRC="1\g29.jpg" ALIGN="RIGHT">&nbsp;Despite his father's 
                    order,&nbsp;<BR>Prahalad continued to pray to 
                    Vishnu.&nbsp;So the demon king wanted to kill his 
                    son.&nbsp;<BR>He asked the favor of his sister 
                    Holika&nbsp;who, because of a boon, was immune to 
                    fire.&nbsp;<BR>They planned that Prahalad would be burned to 
                    death.&nbsp;A pyre was lit up and Holika sat on it, 
                    clutching Prahalad.&nbsp;Yet, at the end Prahalad emerged 
                    unscathed by the fire,&nbsp;And Holika, the demon, was 
                    burned to ashes.&nbsp;The earnest devotion and&nbsp;complete 
                    submission to Lord Vishnu saved&nbsp;young Prahlad. Thus was 
                    the triumph of Prahlad, the representative of good 
                    spirits.&nbsp;And the defeat of Holika, the representative 
                    of evil.&nbsp;Later, even the demon king Hiranyakashipu was 
                    killed by Lord Vishnu.&nbsp;But that is quite a different 
                    story. It is from Holika, that the Holi 
                    originated.&nbsp;<BR>This legend is relived even today on 
                    the Holi-eve&nbsp;when the pyre is re-lit in the form of 
                    bonfires.&nbsp;Even today, people celebrate this 
                    occasion.&nbsp;Huge bonfires are lit up every year&nbsp;on 
                    the eve of the full moon night of the Holi to burn the 
                    spirit of the evils. Hence the story associated with the 
                    soul of the celebration.<BR><BR>Now, let us look into the 
                    face of it. How did the celebration of Holi assume a 
                    colorful face? Well, it is linked to yet another legend, the 
                    legends of Krishna.&nbsp;Though of much later origin, 
                    still,&nbsp;it was in the pre-Christian 
                    era.&nbsp;<BR><BR>According to the Hindu 
                    belief,&nbsp;Krishna was a reincarnation of lord Vishnu 
                    himself.&nbsp;<BR>It was Krishna, or, Krishn, the king of 
                    the ancient city of Dwarka,&nbsp;who popularised the 
                    tradition of Holi.&nbsp;The origin of the colorful and 
                    frolicking tone of Holi&nbsp;lies in the boyhood of 
                    Krishna.&nbsp;It all came up&nbsp;as part of his pranks, he 
                    used to play with his boyhood mates&nbsp;of Gokul and 
                    Vrindavan. Situated in north India,&nbsp;these are the 
                    places where he spent his childhood.&nbsp;<BR><BR>It was at 
                    this time of year, Krishna used to play pranks&nbsp;by 
                    drenching the village girls, with water and colors.&nbsp;At 
                    first it offended the girls. But they were so fond of this 
                    mischievous boy&nbsp;that soon their anger melted away. And, 
                    it did not take long&nbsp;<BR>for other boys to join in, 
                    making it a popular sport in the village. Later, as Krishna 
                    grew up, the play assumed a new dimension.&nbsp;It added 
                    more colors to Krishna's legendary love life.&nbsp;The 
                    legend of Krishna's courtship with Radha,&nbsp;and playing 
                    pranks with the 'Gopi's.&nbsp;The girls in the 'dairy' 
                    village of Gokul were mostly milkmaids,&nbsp;and, hence 
                    locally known as the Gopis. The same tradition has 
                    transpired through the ages, turning it into a community 
                    festival of the masses.&nbsp;As time kept flowing, the 
                    culture spread roots to other regions of the 
                    country.&nbsp;The Holi play of Krishna is documented in 
                    hundreds of ancient paintings,&nbsp;murals, sculptures and 
                    scriptures found across the 
                    subcontinent.</FONT></b><BR><BR></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV></TD></TR>
