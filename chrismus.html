<b><p>For centuries, Christian writers accepted that Christmas was the actual date on which Jesus was born. John Chrysostom preached a sermon 
in Antioch c. 386 which established the date of Christmas as December 25 on the Julian calendar since the conception of Jesus (Luke 1:26)
 had been announced during the sixth month of Elisabeth's pregnancy with John the Baptist (Luke 1:10-13) as dated from the duties Zacharias
 performed on the Day of Atonement during the seventh month of the Hebrew calendar Ethanim or Tishri which falls in September-October.
 In the early 18th century, scholars began proposing alternative explanations. Isaac Newton argued that the date of Christmas was 
 selected to correspond with the winter solstice, which the Romans called bruma and celebrated on December 25. In 1743, German Protestant
  Paul Ernst Jablonski argued Christmas was placed on December 25 to correspond with the Roman solar holiday Dies Natalis Solis Invicti 
  and was therefore a "paganization" that debased the true church. In 1889, Louis Duchesne suggested that the date of Christmas was 
  calculated as nine months after Annunciation, the traditional date of the conception of Jesus.
The December 25 date may have been selected by the church in Rome in the early 4th century. At this time, a church calendar was created 
and other holidays were also placed on solar dates: "It is cosmic symbolism...which inspired the Church leadership in Rome to elect 
the winter solstice, December 25, as the birthday of Christ, and the summer solstice as that of John the Baptist, supplemented by the
 equinoxes as their respective dates of conception. While they were aware that pagans called this day the 'birthday' of Sol Invictus,
  this did not concern them and it did not play any role in their choice of date for Christmas," according to modern scholar S.E. Hijmans.
However, today, whether or not the birth date of Jesus is on December 25 is not considered to be an important issue in mainstream 
Christian denominations; rather, celebrating the coming of God into the world in the form of man to atone for the sins of humanity 
is considered to be the primary meaning of Christmas.</P>

After the mass, people head off home on this hallowed night, and children gambol on their way back, burning sparklers and bursting
 loads of crackers. Everyone sleeps with a peaceful easy feeling, as the next morning brings with it, the Big Day! On Christmas Day, 
 people get ready for the biggest feast. Relatives and friends visit and wish each other a ‘Happy Christmas’ or a ‘Merry Christmas’ 
 and eat the ‘haute cuisine’ especially prepared for the occasion. Many towns hold special carnivals and circus shows on the 25th 
 and the entire community gets together to have a jolly good time. Young people organise excursions, go out to watch films and 
 shows and generally live it up. Thus, all to soon, Christmas comes to an end but each year, it leaves the people with more 
 memories to cherish.</b>
