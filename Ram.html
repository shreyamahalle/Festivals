                  memory of Lord Rama. It occurs on the ninth day (navami). The 
                  festival commemorates the birth of Rama who is remembered for 
                  his preperous and righteous reign. Ramrajya (the reign of 
                  Rama) has become synonymous with a period of peace and 
                  prosperity. Mahatma Gandhi also used this term to describe 
                  how, according to him, India should be after independence.</P>

                  class=boldtextbig>R</FONT>amnavami occurs in the month of 
                  March. Celebrations begin with a prayer to the Sun early in 
                  the morning. At midday, when Lord Rama is supposed to have 
                  been born, a special prayer is performed. In northern India 
                  especially, an event that draws popular participation is the 
                  Ramnavami procession. The main attraction in this procession 
                  is a gaily decorated chariot in which four persons are dressed 
                  up as Rama, his brother Laxman, his queen Sita and his 
                  disciple Hanuman. The chariot is accompanied by several other 
                  persons dressed up in ancient costumes as work by Rama's 
                  solders. The procession is a gusty affair with the 
                  participants shouting praises echoing the happy days of Rama's 
                  reign.</P>

                  source of light and heat even in ancient times. The importance 
                  of the Sun was much more in the higher latitudes from where 
                  the Aryans are supposed to have migrated into India. Many 
                  royal dynasties potrayed symbols of virility like the Sun, 
                  Eagle, Lion etc. as their progenitor. Rama's dynasty 
                  considered themselves to have descended from the Sun. This 
                  could have led to the tagging on, of Rama's birthday to a 
                  festival devoted to the sun.</P>

                  class=boldtextbig>O</FONT>n the face of it Sri-Ramnavmi 
                  appears to be just a festival commemorating the reign of a 
                  king who was later deified. But even behind present-day 
                  traditions there are clues which unmistakably point to the 
                  origin of Ramnavmi as lying beyond the Ramayana story.</P>

                  class=boldtextbig>S</FONT>ri Ramnavami occurs at the beginning 
                  of summer when the sun has started moving nearer to the 
                  northern hemisphere. The Sun is considered to be the 
                  progenitor of Rama's dynasty which is called the Sun dynasty 
                  (Raghukula or Raghuvamsa, Raghu means Sun and Kula or Vamsa 
                  mean familial descendant). Rama is also known as Raghunatha, 
                  Raghupati, Raghavendra etc. That all these names begin with 
                  the prefix Raghu is also suggestive of some link with 
                  Sun-worship. The hour chosen for the observance of the lord's 
                  birth is that when the sun is overhead and is at its maximum 
                  brilliance. In some Hindu sects, prayers on Ramnavami day 
                  start not with an invocation to Rama but to Surya (sun). Again 
                  the syllable Ra is used in the word to describe the sun and 
                  brilliance in many languages. In Sanskrit, Ravi and Ravindra 
                  mean Sun.</P>
                  <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT 
                  class=boldtextbig>S</FONT>ignificantly, the ancient Egyptians 
                  termed the sun as Amon Ra or simply as "Ra". In Latin the 
                  syllable Ra is used to connote light. For example, we have 
                  Radiance which emission of light, or Radium which means any 
                  substance emitting light or brilliance. The common element is 
                  the syllable Ra which in many languages is used to derive 
                  words for describing Sun or light.</P>
                  <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT 
                  class=boldtextbig>T</FONT>he occurrence of this syllable in 
                  most names used for Rama alongwith other clues is strongly 
                  suggestive that the festival Ramnavami antedates the R- ayana 
                  and it must have originated much before the Ramayana, as a 
                  'Sun-festival' for invoking the Sun who was recognised as the 
                  source of light and heat even in ancient times. The importance 
                  of the Sun was much more in the higher latitudes from where 
                  the Aryans are supposed to have migrated into India. Many

                  <P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT 
                  class=boldtextbig>T</FONT>here is some link between Lord Rama 
                  and Sun Worship. The Sun is considered to be the progenitor of 
                  Rama's dynasty which is called the Sun dynasty (Raghukula or 
                  Raghuvamsa, Raghu means Sun and Kula or Vamsa mean familial 
                  descendant). Rama is also known as Raghunatha, Raghupati, 
                  Raghavendra etc. That all these names begin with the prefix 
                  Raghu is also suggestive of some link with Sun-worship. The 
                  hour chosen for the observance of the lord's birth is that 
                  when the sun is overhead and is at its maximum brilliance. 
                  Significantly, the ancient Egyptians termed the sun as Amon Ra 
                  or simply as "Ra". In Latin the syllable Ra is used to connote 
                  light. For example, we have Radiance which emission of light, 
                  or Radium which means any substance emitting light or

                  many languages is used to derive words for describing Sun or 
                  light.</P></TD></FONT>
